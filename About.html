<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>	
Santal Academy at the Sido-Kanhu Murmu University, Dumka, Jharkhand was established in 1996 but it had been dormant except the building itself which is being used as the office of the Vice-Chancellor as the university has not got her own buildings yet.The new Vice-Chancellor Prof.(Dr.) Victor Tigga who is also the chairman of the Academy and his Pro-Vice-Chancellor Prof.(Dr) Promodini Hansdak who is secretary of the Academy took keen interest in the Academy and after years of inactivity suddenly decided to do something about it.They managed to get some funding and with the help and support of the advisory committee members organised the 1st state level Santali Language and Literature seminar on 27th & 28th Feb.2009 and it was concluded successfully in spite of initial teething problems and change of dates at the last moment.
</p>
<p>
At last it turned out to be a successful Seminar.The Chief guest on the occasion was Mr. Sido Hembrom IPS, D.I.G, Ranchi and the guest of honour was Dr. Anil K. Shrivastava, Director of Higher Education, Govt of Jharkhand.The resource persons and other important guests included Dr. P,C. Hembrom, past Vice-Chancellor of SKM university, Dumka, Profs.Digamber Hansdak and Dr K,C Tudu, Prof.(Dr) Bahadur Mishra of Tilka Manjhi University, Bhagalpur.Mr Nirmal BK Soren,poet and writer from Kolkatta,Mr, Cunda Soren" sipahi", Mr Rasik Besra and many others interested in Santali language and literature.Most of the santal lecturers and Prof. of all constituent colleges and many students attended the Seninar which was concluded with culture programmes arranged by the local students.A high quality souvenir was also published.
Tributes were paid to some of the past poets and writers who are no more with us including Late Babulal Murmu "Adivasi" who passed away only few weeks ago.A short clips of his video interview and flute playing was screened on the occasion which was greatly appreciated by all.
 But this is only the bigining and we hope to hear more about such activities in coming years.
